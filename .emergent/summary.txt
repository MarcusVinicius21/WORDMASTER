The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the development of the Wordmaster Beach Búzios full-stack application. The project started with a comprehensive product description, initially targeting a PostgreSQL database, but was adapted to MongoDB based on user clarification. The engineer focused on building core frontend components using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui, while also establishing the backend API routes and MongoDB schema.

Significant progress was made in scaffolding the application, creating dynamic pages for categories and listings, and seeding the database with initial data including listings, amenities, promotions, and reviews. The frontend's visual aspects were largely established, and a basic integration with the backend for data fetching was implemented. The most recent work involved starting the implementation of the  panel, as requested by the user, by creating the admin page and adding corresponding API endpoints. The work stopped due to an import conflict encountered during the testing of the newly added admin panel, indicating that the admin functionality is incomplete and requires immediate attention.

-   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: For Admin, Editor, Viewer roles in the admin panel.
-   **WhatsApp Integration**: Custom button for direct communication with a pre-filled message.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a Next.js App Router structure, with server and client components. The backend API is handled by Next.js API routes, connected to a MongoDB database.



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the root layout for the entire application, including the HTML structure, global styles, and shared components like header and footer.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup for the Next.js application, likely including ,  tags,  imports, and integration of . It also sets up  for dark/light mode if shadcn/ui's setup was followed.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Represents the home page of the application, displaying the hero section, carousels (Featured, Most Viewed, On Promotion), and listing cards.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial rendering of the home page structure. Later, it was updated to integrate with the backend API to fetch listing data for the carousels and display dynamic content.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Handles dynamic category pages (e.g., , ), displaying listings filtered by the specific category.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to fetch and display listings based on the  parameter in the URL, incorporating filters and sorting as requested in the product requirements.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Serves as the entry point for the administrative panel, where Adson can manage listings and other site content.
    -   **Changes Made**: Recently created to establish the admin dashboard, though its full functionality and specific UI elements are still under development.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This file acts as the primary backend API endpoint for the Next.js application, handling all data interactions with the MongoDB database. It consolidates various API routes (e.g., for listings, amenities, promotions, reviews, admin functionalities).
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially set up with basic CRUD operations for listings. It was later modified to support expanded seeding for listings, promotions, and reviews, and most recently, to incorporate endpoints for the admin panel functionalities. This file uses a  function to manage different HTTP methods and path segments.

-   ** (e.g., , , , , , , , , )**:
    -   **Importance**: These are shadcn/ui components that provide the visual building blocks for the application's user interface, ensuring consistency and adherence to the design system.
    -   **Changes Made**: These files were created by the AI engineer as needed to implement the various UI elements required for the frontend and later for the admin panel.

The database schema (originally PostgreSQL) was adapted to MongoDB concepts. The core collections include , , , , , , and , as outlined in the initial . These are managed through the  file.

-   Address frontend issues identified during testing, specifically API routing inconsistencies and carousel implementation.
-   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for the admin panel.
-   Integrate image storage for listing media with drag-and-drop gallery.
-   Develop CSV import, webhooks, and SEO features as outlined in the requirements.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively working on implementing the administrative panel for the Wordmaster Beach Búzios application.

The engineer had:
1.  Created the main admin page at  to serve as the entry point for Adson to manage the application's content.
2.  Modified the main API route file, , to introduce or update endpoints necessary for the admin panel's functionality, such as fetching listings for management.

Upon attempting to test the newly implemented admin panel, an error occurred, specifically an import conflict. This indicates that while the basic files for the admin panel have been created and backend endpoints updated, the admin interface is not yet fully functional, and there's a specific coding issue that needs to be resolved before further progress on the admin panel can be made. The current state is that the admin panel is initiated but is in a broken state due to this import issue, and the broader admin functionalities (CRUD, reports, settings) are still largely unimplemented.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the import conflict within the admin panel's codebase.
